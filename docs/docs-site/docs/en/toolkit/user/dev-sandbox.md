# dev-sandbox

`dev-sandbox` is a C++ tool for measuring data-movement performance independently through its `copy`, `trans` and `aio` test programs. When investigating slow KV loading, you can measure one transfer step involving host memory, device memory or storage, then compare it with loading behavior in the service.

Use it when:

- Storage read bandwidth is healthy but KV loading remains slow, so the host-to-device copy needs a separate measurement.
- Comparing host-memory allocation methods, copy engines or multi-device data-distribution patterns.
- Comparing timings and bandwidth at a fixed data size and test case after changing a low-level transfer implementation.

The tool reports timings and bandwidth for the selected test case without loading a model or starting an inference service. Available cases depend on the compiled backend. This page focuses on Ascend H2D copies, covering normal memory, O_DIRECT and shared memory allocation modes, multi-stream CE and FFTS direct H2D SDMA engines, and GQA (per-card local memory) and MLA (one shared buffer distributed to all cards) topologies. See the [developer guide](../developer/dev-sandbox.md) for builds and other backends.

## IO Flow and UCM KV Cache

UCM uses a tiered KV cache: device memory (HBM, fastest) → host memory (layer cache, second) → disk (POSIX store, slowest). When a request's required KV data misses device memory, it must be loaded from host memory (or disk) back to device memory. This **host-to-device (H2D) copy** step is exactly what dev-sandbox `copy` measures; the `aio` sub-feature separately measures disk dump/load bandwidth.

Different transport engines represent different hardware copy paths during the H2D stage:

| Transport Engine | Description | UCM Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-stream CE (`--sdma false`) | Copy Engine hardware DMA, 4 concurrent streams for higher throughput. | Standard H2D loading path: copying KV blocks from host layer cache back to device memory. |
| FFTS direct H2D SDMA (`--sdma true`) | SDMA direct H2D path with FFTS fast task scheduling, lower latency. | KV loading bandwidth evaluation for the direct H2D path. |

Host memory allocation modes correspond to different KV sources/topologies:

| Allocation Mode | Description | Topology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal host memory (`--iodirect false`) | Pinned host memory, one copy per card. | GQA: each card loads its own KV from local host buffer. |
| O_DIRECT (`--iodirect true`) | O_DIRECT-style mmap host memory, bypasses page cache, closer to UCM's direct file read path. | GQA: local KV read-in path with O_DIRECT enabled per card. |
| Shared memory | A single POSIX shared memory host buffer, distributed to all cards via fork fan-out. | MLA: all cards share the same host KV data. |

Data flow for both topologies:

```text
GQA: each card has its own local host buffer → its own device memory (independent H2D per card)

  host buf(card0) ── multi-stream CE / SDMA ──▶ device HBM(card0)
  host buf(card1) ── multi-stream CE / SDMA ──▶ device HBM(card1)
  host buf(card2) ── multi-stream CE / SDMA ──▶ device HBM(card2)
   ...                                          ...
  host buf(cardN) ── multi-stream CE / SDMA ──▶ device HBM(cardN)

MLA: one shared host buffer fanned out to all cards

                 ┌──▶ device HBM(card0)
 shared host buf ┼──▶ device HBM(card1)   (fork fan-out, multi-stream CE / SDMA per card)
                 └──▶ device HBM(cardN)
```

## Quick Start

```bash
ucm-toolkit run dev-sandbox --model-type <gqa|mla> --iodirect <true|false> --sdma <true|false> [args...]
```

Three selector parameters:

| Parameter | Values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--model-type` | `gqa` / `mla` | Model type. |
| `--iodirect` | `true` / `false` | Whether to enable O_DIRECT (direct IO, bypassing page cache). |
| `--sdma` | `true` / `false` | Whether to use SDMA (direct H2D SDMA transport path). |

Parameter combinations determine the test scenario:

| Model | IO-direct | SDMA | Test Scenario |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gqa` | `false` | `false` | Each card copies from its own local host memory to device memory using multi-stream CE. |
| `gqa` | `true` | `false` | Each card uses O_DIRECT to read from local host memory, multi-stream CE to device. |
| `gqa` | `false` | `true` | Each card copies from host memory to device using FFTS direct H2D SDMA. |
| `gqa` | `true` | `true` | Each card uses O_DIRECT from host memory, via FFTS direct H2D SDMA to device. |
| `mla` | `false` | `false` | A shared host memory is distributed across cards, each using multi-stream CE to its own device. |
| `mla` | `true` | `false` | Same as above (MLA does not distinguish iodirect, same CE path). |
| `mla` | `false` | `true` | A shared host memory is distributed to all device memories via FFTS direct H2D SDMA. |
| `mla` | `true` | `true` | Same as above (MLA does not distinguish iodirect, same SDMA path). |

## Run Parameters

After the three selector parameters, the following optional parameters can be used (defaults apply if omitted):

| Parameter | Description | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-s` | Single data block size | `512M` | `-s 16K`, `-s 1M` |
| `-n` | Number of data blocks | `8` | `-n 512` |
| `-i` | Number of iterations | `128` | `-i 128` |
| `-d` | Number of devices (cards) | `8` | `-d 8` |
| `-f` | Fragment count (SDMA scenarios only) | `0` | `-f 4` |

## Examples

```bash
# Test GQA + multi-stream CE: 16K blocks × 512 blocks × 128 iterations × 8 cards
ucm-toolkit run dev-sandbox --model-type gqa --iodirect false --sdma false \
  -s 16K -n 512 -i 128 -d 8

# Test MLA shared distribution + SDMA with default parameters
ucm-toolkit run dev-sandbox --model-type mla --iodirect false --sdma true
```

### Output Example

Below is actual output from two commands on an 8-card Ascend 910B3 (values vary by machine):

GQA + multi-stream CE (each card's own local host buffer → its own device memory):

```text
[[ all_host_to_all_device_ce_multi_stream ]] memcpy from all host to all device with ce using multi stream and fork submit
  From              To                Method    Size(KB)  Count   Submit(us)-(Min/Max/Avg/P50/P90)        Copy(us)-(Min/Max/Avg/P50/P90)              BW(GB/s)
  acl::host::all    acl::device::all  CE-MS-FORK16        4096    878 / 2576 / 1117 / 1112 / 1269         3155 / 4101 / 3736 / 3759 / 3905            16.729
```

MLA + multi-stream CE (one shared host buffer fanned out to all cards):

```text
[[ one_share_host_to_all_device_ce_multi_stream ]] memcpy from one shared host to all device with ce using multi stream and fork submit
  From              To                Method    Size(KB)  Count   Submit(us)-(Min/Max/Avg/P50/P90)        Copy(us)-(Min/Max/Avg/P50/P90)              BW(GB/s)
  acl::shm::0       acl::device::all  CE-MS-FORK16        4096    1056 / 1270 / 1162 / 1161 / 1209        3914 / 5024 / 4471 / 4424 / 4852            13.979
```

MLA uses `acl::shm::0` as the data source (shared memory), GQA uses `acl::host::all` (per-card host memory); both have `Count` = "card count × `-n`" (8 × 512 = 4096). The `--sdma true` FFTS direct H2D SDMA path requires the machine to support FFTS features; the output format is the same, only `Method`/`Copy` values differ.

Output field descriptions:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Title line `[[ ... ]]` | Actual executed case name and summary; used to confirm which case `--model-type`/`--iodirect`/`--sdma` mapped to. |
| `From` / `To` | Source / destination memory type. `acl::host::all` = per-card host memory, `acl::shm::0` = shared memory, `acl::device::all` = all device memories. |
| `Method` | Transport engine, e.g. `CE-MS-FORK` = multi-stream CE + fork fan-out (column width is exactly filled by the method name, so in output `CE-MS-FORK` and the following `Size(KB)` value appear concatenated as `CE-MS-FORK16`). |
| `Size(KB)` | Single data block size, corresponds to `-s` (e.g. `-s 16K` → `16`). |
| `Count` | Total number of data blocks actually copied. In multi-card fork scenarios, this is "card count × `-n`" (e.g. 8 cards × 512 = 4096). |
| `Submit(us)` | Submit phase timing statistics (microseconds), given as Min/Max/Avg/P50/P90. |
| `Copy(us)` | Actual copy timing statistics (microseconds), given as Min/Max/Avg/P50/P90; basis for bandwidth calculation. |
| `BW(GB/s)` | Aggregate bandwidth = `Size × Count × 1e6 / Copy.avg`, in GB/s, higher is better. |
